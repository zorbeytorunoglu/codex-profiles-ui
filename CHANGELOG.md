## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.0]

### Added

- `doctor` command with `--fix` and `--json` for scriptable diagnostics and safe storage repairs
- profile label management commands: `label set`, `label clear`, and `label rename`
- profile export and import commands for backup and transfer bundles
- exact `--id` selectors for `load`, `delete`, and `status`, plus saved-profile `status` selectors with `--label` and `--id`
- `load --force`, `list --json`, `list --show-id`, and machine-readable `--json` output for mutating commands, `status`, and `doctor`

### Changed

- `--json` is now a global CLI option, and mutating commands emit a consistent success response shape
- `status` now refreshes usage auth on `401` responses, syncs refreshed credentials back to the saved active profile when possible, and formats auth/usage HTTP errors in a Codex-style layout
- `status --all --json` now returns a single `profiles` array that includes API-key and errored profiles, and human-readable output now uses "active profile" wording
- top-level `--help` output now uses shorter examples, highlights `--json` support more clearly, and label subcommands now spell out the required `--label`/`--id` selector more clearly
- the manual installer now resolves the latest published GitHub release automatically when no version is pinned, while still honoring `CODEX_PROFILES_VERSION` and `--version`
- Cargo installs now require Rust 1.94 or newer
- package and README metadata now describe the tool in terms of switching between multiple Codex accounts
- status usage lookups now only allow official ChatGPT hosts or loopback addresses for `chatgpt_base_url`, and non-file Codex auth store modes are rejected

### Fixed

- usage fetching now retries transient transport, `5xx`, and rate-limit failures more robustly and supports grouped multi-bucket usage limits
- installer and release downloads now verify checksums from the tagged GitHub release by default, with a guarded insecure bypass for environments that explicitly set `CODEX_PROFILES_ALLOW_INSECURE_INSTALL=1`
- npm and Bun update-source detection is more reliable
- regular remote error output now uses aligned multiline blocks while JSON output preserves raw backend detail
- errors always exit non-zero and write to stderr only; stdout is never polluted with partial JSON on error

### Removed

- `status --all --show-errors` flag and hidden-profile summary/count modes

### Internal

- `anyhow` dependency was removed; `updates.rs` now uses `Result<T, String>` consistently
- auth refresh now refuses to rewrite drifted on-disk auth state
- release packaging now emits a release manifest, verifies generated artifacts more strictly, and publishes npm packages with provenance plus GitHub attestations
- release and CI workflows were hardened, pinned more explicitly, and now include a scheduled security-audit workflow
- integration and regression coverage expanded for JSON output, release artifacts, status/profile edge cases, and profile storage repair paths

### Documentation

- README now documents export/import, label workflows, doctor repair behavior, and release verification more thoroughly
- added a release verification guide covering `SHA256SUMS`, `release-manifest.json`, GitHub attestations, npm provenance, and `.crate` verification

## [0.2.0] - 2026-02-21

### Added

- `status --all --show-errors` to include errored profiles in the output
- Hidden-profile summaries in `status --all` (API profiles and errored profiles)

### Fixed

- Profile deduplication now uses a composite identity key (`principal_id` + `workspace_or_org_id` + `plan_type`) to prevent false matches
- Profile lifecycle operations now preserve update cache and handle save/load/delete edge cases more safely
- Installer trap variable scoping bug that could break cleanup on some shells
- Release bump flow now syncs npm optional package versions and installer default `VERSION` correctly
- CI cache config updated to remove deprecated `rust-cache` parameters and invalid `save-if` usage

### Changed

- Simplified profile state machine and status rendering logic
- Profile ordering changed from last-used timestamp sorting to deterministic profile-id ordering
- `list` and `status` no longer perform implicit current-profile sync side effects
- "Unknown last-used" badge is now hidden instead of shown as a placeholder

### Removed

- Last-used timestamp tracking in `profiles.json` profile metadata
- Legacy `cx` shorthand script (use `codex-profiles` directly)

### Internal

- Installer and release scripts hardened for edge-case reliability
- CI: removed unused `sccache` from workflow jobs
- Added repository checksum file for previous release (`checksums/v0.1.0.txt`)

### Documentation

- README: reorganized badges, added a tests badge, and fixed license badge color
- README: added Cargo installation instructions
- CONTRIBUTING: documented release-tag bump behavior for npm optional packages and installer defaults

## [0.1.0] - 2026-01-28

### Added

**Core Features**
